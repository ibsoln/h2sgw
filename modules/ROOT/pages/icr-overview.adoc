[abstract]

Sync Gateway to Sync Gateway replication, or inter-cluster replication, uses SG Replicate protocol to enable replication between mobile clusters, or between a hub and its spoke clusters.
--

== Overview

Couchbase Sync Gateway supports inter-cluster replication. That is, the ability to run replications between two Sync Gateway clusters.
SG-Replicate 2.0 is the protocol that supports that replication.
Documents go through the Sync Function on the target Sync Gateway instance, which ensures that access permissions are updated.
On the architecture diagram below, any changes that users/systems make on either Sync Gateway instance will be replicated to the other Sync Gateway instance.

NOTE: A _Sync Gateway database_ can also be referred to as a namespace for documents, the data is *always* stored in Couchbase Server.

== SG Replicate vs XDCR

xref:server:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[XDCR] (cross data centre replication) is the Couchbase Server API to replicate between Couchbase Server clusters.
Both XDCR and SG Replicate can be used to keep clusters in different data centres in sync.
However, SG Replicate was designed specifically for a Couchbase Mobile deployment and must be used for replication between mobile clusters.

== Features

* Replicates via the Sync Gateway REST API
* JSON configuration to specify replications
* Supports multiple replications running concurrently
* Can run both OneShot and Continuous replications
* Does not store anything persistently
* Stateless -- can be interrupted/restarted anytime without negative side effects
* Can specify which channel(s) to sync
* Supports Primary/Primary and Primary/Secondary topologies

== Limitations

* Can only replicate SG databases that are hosted on recent versions of Sync Gateway (after commit 50d30eb3d on March 7, 2014)
* In deployments with multiple Sync Gateway nodes, only _one_ of the Sync Gateways should be configured for replications.
If multiple Sync Gateways are configured for replications, it could substantially increase the amount of duplicate work, and therefore should be avoided.
The limitation is that the system is not guaranteed to be Highly Available: if the Sync Gateway that is chosen to drive the replication goes down or is otherwise removed from the system, then the replications will stop.
* Replication between Sync Gateway databases doesn't support automatic conflict resolution even when the no-conflicts mode is enabled (i.e xref:config-properties.adoc#databases-foo_db-allow_conflicts["allow_conflicts": false]).
When running two Sync Gateway clusters with the no-conflicts mode enabled, cross-cluster document conflicts will result in that document no longer being replicated.
Deployments  must implement a custom conflict resolver in an external app as specified xref:resolving-conflicts.adoc[here].
To avoid this, the application must ensure concurrent, cross-cluster updates are not made to a given document.
